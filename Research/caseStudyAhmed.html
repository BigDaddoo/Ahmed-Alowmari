            Positive Action is a K-12 SEL program that can be added to any curriculum. It focuses on building positive relationships, mental health, and managing emotions and behavior.

            The research and work behind this program is top class. The unit lessons cover diverse topics such as nutrition, problem-solving, decision-making, study skills, self-control, managing personal resources, social skills, self-honesty, and setting and achieving goals. Third-party groups have done outcome evaluations of the program and found positive results and much growth.

            Something I believe that could improve the program for our modern situation is contextualizing the learning. The occurrence of extreme global events such as the pandemic have made applying these skills difficult because of drastic changes such as quarantine and ever growing presence of social media.
