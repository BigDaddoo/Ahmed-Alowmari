            Positive Action is a K-12 SEL program that can be added to any curriculum. It focuses on building positive relationships, mental health, and managing emotions and behavior. Positive Action, which was created in 1982, has been used in more than 16,000 schools and includes more than 1,800 lessons designed to improve studentsâ€™ SEL abilities over time.

            The Positive Action program is built upon two basic elements of the Positive Action System:

            <ul> 
                <li>Content: Which goes on about their Thoughts-Actions-Feelings philosophy which states that our thoughts lead to actions and those actions lead to feelings about ourselves which in turn lead to more thoughts. Through Six units, students are shown how to have a positive cycle to improve in their SEL development. </li>
            
                <p></p>
                
                <li>Tools: How the content is delivered through training sessions covering the appropriate grade-level curriculum and components, in addition to best practices for implementation, virtually or in-person, the program outcomes and studies that produced them, and evaluation tools.</li>
            
            </ul>

            The research and work behind this program is top class. The unit lessons cover diverse topics such as nutrition, problem-solving, decision-making, study skills, self-control, managing personal resources, social skills, self-honesty, and setting and achieving goals. Third-party groups have done outcome evaluations of the program and found positive results and much growth.

            Something I believe that could improve the program for our modern situation is contextualizing the learning. The occurrence of extreme global events such as the pandemic have made applying these skills difficult because of drastic changes such as quarantine and ever growing presence of social media.
