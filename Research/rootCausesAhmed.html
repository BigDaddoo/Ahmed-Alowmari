            Historical Context: 
            <br>
            SEL began in the 1960s at the Yale School of Medicine in its Child Study Center where Professor James Comer started the Comer School Development Program where he focused on the education systems of low-income African-American communities. The school implemented programs that focused on the social and emotional needs of the students. The approach has spread and consideration for student’s social emotional development has become a hot topic.

            Root Cause #1: Self-isolation during quarantine has hurt student’s ability to develop their SEL skills and rely more on technology. 
        </div>   
        <div class="row border-info border-2">
            Evidence:
            <b>
            The numbers showed that loneliness caused an increase in escape motivation, relying on impulse, and problematic phone usage; it also showed a decrease in self-control (1). It was also stated that “for months following quarantine members of the isolated population still practiced avoidance of crowds and vigilant hand washing, in addition to delays in returns to normalcy more broadly” (2).

        <div class="row border-info border-2">
            Explanation:
            <b>
            This is important as it shows how loneliness increased during quarantine, which has caused negative effects on SEL development  that last even post-quarantine.

        <div class="row border-info border-2">
            Implications:
            <b>
            This highlights how students need some sort of service to help them develop their Social Emotional Learning.
